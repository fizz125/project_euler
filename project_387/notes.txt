problem 387

for 2011 to be a right truncatable harshad prime
201 must be a right truncatable harshad prime

but if we start from 1 and work our way up
 *we already know 201 is right truncatable harshad prime*

so we take 201 and test
 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019
to see if they're divisible by the sum of their digits
which ever ones are, *must be* harshad primes

add them to the array
get the next un tested number
append a digit
continue until the numbers + a digit > 10^15

then test for primality and strong primality


Generate all right trucatable harshad numbers first
Then figure out which of those are "strong harshad numbers" (which ones when divided by the sum of their digits results in a prime qutotient)
Then figure out which of those are + 1 right diget are prime (need to implement primality check algorithm)
